# 🎒 Feature Selection via Knapsack Optimization

This project was developed for the **"Computational Problems and Techniques"** course at the **University of Jordan**. It demonstrates how to transform a machine learning challenge (Feature Selection) into a classic combinatorial optimization problem (The Knapsack Problem).

## 💡 Computational Problem Formulation
In this project, we treat the selection of features as an optimization task where we aim to maximize the "Value" (Accuracy & Explainability) while staying within a "Weight" constraint (Computational Cost/Budget).

## 🚀 Technical Highlights
* **Problem Mapping**: Mapping high-dimensional data features to Knapsack items.
* **Cost-Aware Selection**: Unlike standard filter/wrapper methods, this approach incorporates a resource budget (Capacity).
* **Algorithmic Comparison**: Evaluation against traditional techniques like L1 Regularization and Wrapper methods.
* **Classifier**: All techniques were tested using a **Random Forest** model to ensure computational consistency.
